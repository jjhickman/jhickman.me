# HeyðŸ‘‹, I am Josh Hickman

As a **Senior Software Engineer**, I developed scalable and innovative robotics solutions at [Boston Dynamics](https://bostondynamics.com). I have over 7 years of experience in software engineering, with a focus on web development and platform. I am proficient in React, TypeScript, Node.js, Python, C++, and Linux, and have developed scalable microservice applications, RESTful APIs, and gRPC APIs. I also have experience in leading workshops and advising teams on containerization and cloud technologies such as Amazon Web Services. I am passionate about creating user-friendly and efficient interfaces for robots and autonomous systems, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and skills.

Previously, I was a **Software Engineer** at [SICK Sensor Intelligence](https://sick.com), a company specializing in hardware for warehouse and logistics automation solutions, where I leveraged my skills in AWS, Docker, C++, and Lua to build scalable solutions deployed in distribution centers across the country.

I studied at the **University of Tennessee** and received my B.S. in **Computer Science** in 2018.
